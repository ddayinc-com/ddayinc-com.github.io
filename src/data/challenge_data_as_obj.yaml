The shakes began drawing thermal energy from deep within Jeremy's core, fueled by their desire to restore equilibrium with their surroundings. Brr.

After a short reprieve, and a couple of more sips, Jeremy was half out the door to the patio and throwing up a bit of the Cool Treats that he had enjoyed throwing down.

Then, shortly after getting back to the challenge, the milk that Greg had already consumed was not enjoying the one-half (1/2) pot of coffee that Greg had for breakfast:  it wanted out. It came up once, but Greg gulped it back down. The next two (2) abdominal contractions could not be overcome in the same manner, and Greg chunked out the milk into a nearby trash can. Milk did not do a body good in this case. \r\nNote: one of the pictures is semi-graphic."

Though no official readings were taken, a few lookers-on estimated that Tom's core body temperature dropped by three (3) degrees Fahrenheit. A couple of veteran milk challengers were on hand, including the incumbent champ. Each of them eagerly offered \"tips\" to Tom in efforts to thwart the attempt. The tips did not phase him. A couple of questionable \"coughs\" had the crowd expecting to see the milk again, but Tom kept it in. Two short hours later his stomach was settled."

As always, Greg was able to work in his now famous catch phrase, \"It hurts\". On two separate occasions, Greg dispersed the crowd like Dawn dish soap does grease when he nearly vomited, with a few of them in the would-be projectile's path. Except during the two scares, spectators kept flowing a steady stream of euphemisms about eating nuts. Mentions of \"nut bags\" and of \"deez nuts\" were aplenty, and kept spectators in stitches."

  FailureDetails: "Viktor was attempting to eat thirty-six (36) ounces of delicious cheese, but after about 1/2 dozen cheese wedges (0.75 ounces each), Vik \"knew [she] was not going to be able to complete the assignment\". After a baker's dozen of the Laughing Cow's cheese wedges, Red felt a \"strong tickle\" on the right side of her head. The Cow did not stop tickling her until she said 'uncle'. After sixteen (16) Cow wedges she developed a slight fever. That is how to tell that you have selected a fine cheese product. After the 2nd dozen of wedges, the urge to purge came over Viktoriya. So, she ate a piece of candy and threw down one more wedge for good measure. The Cow got the last laugh, stopping her short of her goal. She did keep down the wholesome goodness, though.<BR />Side note: Viktoriya actually laughed the last laugh about four (4) hours after the challenge upon utilizing the latrine and disproving the age old adage about the cork-like effect of large quantities of cheese on the user's system.

  RecordSummary: "Ate five (5) quarter-pound hotdog sandwiches in 20 min, 55sec"
  RecordDetails: "Alex, in his maiden challenge, decided to tackle an existing record, believing that he could better said record by eating five (5) quarter-pound hot dogs from the exclusive Sam's Club in less than twenty-two (22) minutes.<BR />\r\n<SPAN CLASS='indented'>The</SPAN> start: obvious excitement. Alex was raring to go. One of the event coordinators reported that the anxious Alex thought that he might even dispatch the delicious dogs in less than ten (10) minutes. \"Go!\", called the time keeper.  Alex tore into the first delectable dog, which he destroyed in the blink of an eye: gone in fifty-five (55) seconds. Now for the second wiener dog: sent to meet its maker in another short eighty-five (85) seconds, putting Alex at the 2m 20s mark. \"These <I>are</I> juicy\", he noted.<BR />\r\n<SPAN CLASS='indented'>An</SPAN> astonishing pace -- can this dog whisperer keep it up? 0.5 flavor-packed hot dogs later: \"No\". Alex shows his first sign of relenting. And, to the crowd's dismay, utters something about the dreaded \"wall\", followed by \"That's a lot of meat!\"<BR />\r\n<SPAN CLASS='indented'>Passers-by</SPAN> scarcely paid attention to the action-packed event, until Alex started \"making room\", burping out several air pockets of wasted space. One of the powerful belches scared a small child as she strolled by the challenge area. The ladies seated at the table in front of Alex did not appear to mind too much, though the breeze from another of the mighty expulsions surely brushed by them. He briefly entertained the idea of making room by visiting the latrine, but no one seemed interested in accompanying him.<BR />\r\n<SPAN CLASS='indented'>After</SPAN> clearing his mind, Alex went back on the offensive. He finished the third-, and then, with more calculated, precise bites, eventually made it through the fourth delightful dog. He periodically chatted up his peeps on the cellaphone, and sent out the occassional text. Finally -- the fifth and final hot dog. Alex was occasionally letting people know that there is a whole lot of meat flavor in those heavenly hot dogs, and pushed on towards the finish. Time began to get short, and Alex needed one more focus-session. With renewed vigor, he attacked the final hind quarters of the dog, taking approximately four (4) bites to give the last hot-diggity dog its new [temporary] home.<BR />\r\n<SPAN CLASS='indented'>Total</SPAN> time: 20m 55s. Alex has become the wiener dog king.  For now...\r\n<DIV CLASS=\"txtC\"><IMG ALT='Wiener Dogs' TITLE='Wiener Dogs' SRC='imgs/dogicon.gif' /></DIV>\r\n"

Almost immediately after said cup, Misty found herself gathering her things in preparation to disgorge the sugar-free snack. She dashed outdoors and emitted some Jello-air.

  RecordDetails: "Steve crunched his way through twenty-one (21) beef tacos -- all hard-shell. The weight: he was able to choke down about 3.6 pounds (1,638g) of authentic Taco Bell tacos. The time: fifty-nine minutes and twenty-four seconds (59m 24s) -- about thirty-six (36) spare seconds in the one-hour timed challenge. Steady in pace throughout the challenge, Steve was forced to stuff face during the last two (2) minutes or so, furiously chomping away at the final taco and shoveling-in the 'shrapnel' that had fallen to the table below his dangerous pie hole.<BR />\r\n\r\n<SPAN CLASS='indented'>When</SPAN> he began, Steve announced that he does not even like Taco Bell tacos; he echoed this sentiment several times throughout the challenge. As one spectator pointed out, this dislike is quite the opposite of the norm for a regular food challenge attempt. Usually the contestant thoroughly enjoys, or at least mildly tolerates, the subject of their challenge. The distaste for the subject usually grows as the challenge progresses. Steve seems to select a subject that displeases him, attack it in a food challenge, and then develop a fondness for the item at some point after the challenge (he went through this cycle at the time of his BW3's chicken leg challenge).<BR />\r\n\r\n<SPAN CLASS='indented'>A</SPAN> local photographer captured oodles of challenge images (and some images of the peanut-gallery). Side note: the given Taco Bell was quite a bee's nest of honeys, of whom the photographer captured some images (mostly by design) in his fine camera work."

P-Rice downed the first dozen potstickers in as many minutes. After another brief delay (for the cooks to prepare another dozen), she was again dunkin' and grinnin', stickin' it to those potstickers. Bam! In 31 minutes and 28 seconds, those poor potstickers had been pounded by the P-Rice eating machine. Was that enough to please her? Of course not -- she had a plate of food from the buffet, some dessert, and, of course, a fortune cookie. Her fortune? \"You will sit on a throne in the near future -- take something to read\".<DIV CLASS=\"txtC\"><IMG ALT='Mmm -- potstickers' TITLE='Mmm -- potstickers' SRC='imgs/icons/pstickersicon.gif' /></DIV>"

  RecordSummary: "Ate eighteen (18) ounces of Double Stuf Oreos in forty-five (45)"
  RecordDetails: "Liz, in her inaugural food challenge, made all of the school kids jealous when she lived their meal-time dream: cookies for lunch. No sharing, no \"eat your vegetables\", no two-cookie limit. She enjoyed one (1) eighteen (18) ounce package of Oreos. When asked, \"Double Stuft?\", Liz exclaimed \"Of course!\". Three (3) dozen Double Stuf Oreos.<BR />\r\n<SPAN CLASS=\"indented\">After</SPAN> one-third (1/3) of the package, Liz began to get serious about the treat. She was no longer using the brute force dunk-and-slam method, but moved into the unscrew-and-savor method popularized by Oreo commercials around the world. However, Liz decided to use \"spider milk\" as one spectator called it -- Silk Soy Milk. Mmm.<BR />\r\n<SPAN CLASS=\"indented\">At</SPAN> the two-third (2/3) package mark came a food challenge staple -- the shakes. The Oreo Kid's steady hands began to tremble a bit, presumably due to the excitement (and potentially due to the 5.5oz of straight sugar in the cookies that she had consumed so far). As she neared the end of the challenge, Liz was able to retain control on at least one finger. She displayed said finger to the crowds without falter as a few hecklers began their \"eat another bag\" grumblings.<BR />\r\n<SPAN CLASS=\"indented\">Then,</SPAN> finally, the Oreo that she was looking for -- the last one. Success. Eighteen (18) ounces of Double Stuf Oreos in forty-five (45) minutes. Oh, and that sugar count? 8.25oz of sugar -- over one-half (1/2) pound. Not only did Liz get to indulge, but she ended up with a considerably fatter pocketbook. Since most of her teeth fell out almost immediately due to sugar-rot, Liz cashed in as the Toof-Fairy visited that very evening and bought the busted lot of them. Liz -- a Double winner.\r\n<DIV CLASS=\"txtC\"><IMG ALT='Double Stuft' TITLE='Double Stuft' SRC='imgs/icons/oreoicon.gif' /></DIV>"

  RecordSummary: "Consumed 30 hush puppies from Long John Silver's in thirty-two ("
  RecordDetails: "AJ ordered up a dozen delectable hush puppies and a kid-size drink. Served on a fresh bed of \"krums\" (a.k.a. Crumblies?), the little health-pellets arrived and AJ got to work. *Chomp* -- two gone, and within five (5) minutes, AJ had downed the entire dirty dozen. \"Two more baskets, please\" -- eighteen (18) hush puppies this order. Being a chef, AJ was sure to spruce up the meal, using an array of condiments from ketchup and cocktail sauce to tartar sauce and malt vinegar. Mmm, mmm, good!<BR />\r\n<SPAN CLASS='indented'>The</SPAN> noxious malt vinegar fumes, on several occasions, came close to overpowering attendees. AJ himself nearly hucked up a litter of hush puppies thanks to the power of said fumes. Twenty-eight (28) in: \"This is <__>ing disgusting\" -- the remaining two (2) hush puppies held a glimmer of hope for a stay of execution. AJ quickly crushed that hope by squeezing the life out of the last couple of hapless pups, wringing some puddles of grease out of them in the process. It was the end of the line for the pair of them. AJ, sure to appease the commission, ate the grease puddles, too. Totals: thirty (30) hush puppies, three (3) kid-sized drinks, and about one-half cup of various condiments in thirty-two (32) minutes.<BR />\r\n<SPAN CLASS='indented'>But</SPAN>, wait, there is more! For the finale, AJ dumped the remaining contents of the malt vinegar dispenser into another kid-size drink cup (estimated vinegar volume of eight (8) ounces) and took it outside. It was time to enjoy a fine malt beverage in the afternoon sun of a brisk December day: AJ guzzled down the strong brew, including the unidentified pebbles that had settled on the bottom. One-and-one-half (1.5) pounds of hush puppies and a half pint of aged Long John Silver's malt vinegar -- what a treat!\r\n<DIV CLASS='txtC'><IMG ALT='hush puppies' TITLE='hush puppies' SRC='imgs/icons/hpuppies_icon.gif' /></DIV>"

  RecordDetails: "<DIV CLASS=\"smFootnote\">Context: This submission comes from a company of Apache Longbow helicopter personnel currently stationed in Iraq. D-Day kept the almost all of the original verbage intact to accurately preserve the events of this fateful day </DIV><SPAN CLASS='indented'>We</SPAN> got into a discussion last week [13 Nov 2005] about a person not being able to drink and keep down a gallon of milk. One of our W-1s* (Dave Harper) said he KNEW he could drink and keep down a gallon of milk in/for one hour. Milk at the mess hall only comes in 250ml containers, so we figured 15 would be about a gallon [quick math: 0.991 gal.]. Dave chose \"Full Cream - NADA Fresh\" milk over skim; bold move. We are not sure if it is milk from a cow, a goat, or a camel. [Nutritional info omitted for space]. We received quite a few looks from the other patrons for the 15 bottles on one tray. Dave started strong at 0752. At 20 minutes into the challenge, he had downed 6 milks. \"That's a lot of fucking milk!\" was his first real hint at cracking. One of the more astute W-1s* went and got a 45 gallon trash bag; good move.<BR /><SPAN CLASS='indented'>A</SPAN> little later Dave [declared], \"I'm scared to burp.\" He finished number 7 by 25 minutes, and his eyes started to glaze over. At the halfway point, he [warned] \"you may want to keep that bag open\" and \"don't make me laugh!\". [Dave] finally choked down number 8 by 37 minutes, but he was hurting. At 40 minutes he had his head down on the table. \"I'm pacing myself\" he stated. At the 45 minute mark he had finished #9, all the time plotting how he would down the last 3 or 4 in the last couple of minutes. But the mess hall was closing, so we all grabbed the milks and started to depart. As we were discussing giving him a few extra minutes to offset the walking time, we looked for Dave. He had ducked into the emergency exit to expunge his milk breakfast. [The result] was a very heavy trash bag, and he almost got some sympathy pukers as we each weighed the bag. [Dave chug-a-lugged 0.594 gal. of milk].<BR /><SPAN CLASS='indented'>Young</SPAN> David now knows that it is not possible to drink a gallon of milk. He has also learned to listen more closely to his senior Warrant Officers. And a couple of us are $20 richer, thanks to young Dave.

  RecordSummary: "Ate thirty (30) chicken wings in fifty-five (55) minutes"
  RecordDetails: "Matt, in his first entry in the food challenge arena, set out to enjoy a hearty helping of chicken wings from BW3's. The first order was eighteen (18) wings:  nine (9) Caribbean Jerk, nine (9) Sweet Barbeque. As with many challenges, the initial pace was strong. Matt, using his patented technique of splitting the wings with one smooth thumb stroke, was downing wings like it was his job. And, what goes with chicken? Well, according to Ludacris, \"beer\" -- so Matt had a tall twenty-two (22) ounce beer to add to the enjoyment.<BR />\r\n<SPAN CLASS=\"indented\">This</SPAN> first eighteen (18) -- child's play. As witnessed by one of the pictures in the <A TITLE=\"Chicken Wings pix -- yum!\" HREF=\"http://ddayinc.com/gallery/records/chickenwings200901\">Chicken Wing gallery</A>, though, Matt was a little surprised by the girth of the some of the wings in the second eighteen (18), all of which were all Caribbean Jerk.. Without regard for his well-being, he pushed on with the task. It was not until the twenty-eighth (28th) wing that Matt even had to set a wing down to pause and reflect. Then, as the timer neared the end, the pace drew to a halt at thirty (30) wings. While we may never know, some spectators believed that the fish sandwich from Burger King a few hours before the event may have still been swimming about in Matt's belly, taking up precious cargo room. Not bad for his first event, though.<BR />\r\n<SPAN CLASS=\"indented\">Some</SPAN> notable quotes:\r\n<UL>\r\n<LI>\"I haven't eaten for a straight hour, well, ever!\"</LI>\r\n<LI>\"Another one and I'll fuggin' blow!\"</LI>\r\n<LI>\"After a while, chicken starts to taste like shit.\" So, apparently, the ol' \"tastes like chicken\" rule is flexible.</LI>\r\n</UL>\r\n<SPAN CLASS=\"indented\">Another</SPAN> tidbit: word of Matt's challenge seemed to have made it around the employees a bit. There was a hefty waitress, waiting in the wings, eyeing Matt, admiring his skills, and licking her chops. But, that is a challenge for another day (and a different challenger, probably).\r\n"

  RecordSummary: "Ate five (5) quarter-pound hotdog-type sandwiches in 22 minutes"
  RecordDetails: "To start out, Ryan stepped up and ordered up four (4) wiener dogs, enough Quarter Pound Kosher Dogs (QPKDs) to run the Sam's Club Snack Bar out of stock for the day. Unfortunately for the readers, these four QPKDs were gone before details with any real meat could be recorded. Ryan scarfed down the snouts, ears, and blended organs that comprised the tasty dogs faster than one could say, \"mechanically separated meat\" (a common wiener dog ingredient). He had impounded that pound of dogs in around twelve (12) minutes.<BR />\r\n<SPAN CLASS='indented'>Still</SPAN> craving questionable, machine-formed meat-stuffs, Ryan returned to the Snack Bar counter to get one (1) Quarter Pound Polish Sausage (QPPS). After man-handling that meat, Ryan felt that challengees should make it a point to thoroughly enjoy their feasts. So, he treated himself to a raspberry-vanilla ice-cream-on-a-stick treat. That is five (5) quarter-pound hotdog-type sandwiches and dessert in twenty-two (22) minutes. Obligatory exclamation: Hot diggity-dog!<BR />\r\n<SPAN CLASS='indented'>After</SPAN> those twenty-two (22) total minutes of food abuse, Ryan came to rest. While no spectators were injured, with Ryan's skills at the lunch table, they should put a safety sign on this guy: \"Keep hands clear while Ryan is destroying food items\".

  RecordSummary: "Consumed 24 hush puppies from Long John Silver's"
  RecordDetails: "Kyle munched down twenty-four (24) of the deep-fried bread nuggets called \"hush puppies\" from the Long John Silver's seafood eatery. In a strong start, Kyle had about one-half of the challenge completed in an astounding five (5) minutes.  Soon, though, he hit the ever-present food challenge wall. Looking down at the remaining unimposing puppies, Kyle sat befuddled, one hand resting over the side of his face. He pondered how the small little side-dish treats could be threatening to turn this, his maiden challenge, into a failed attempt. With about six (6) hush puppies to go he exclaimed that he \"did not know that a hush puppy could be so heavy\"; a perplexed look washed over his face and his eyebrows wove into a frown. Then, the proverbial second wind came to Kyle and he attacked the defenseless pups with renewed vigor, drowning a few of them in ice water before sending them to their demise. Success! After thirty-three minutes, Kyle victoriously threw back the last bite of the two dozen hush puppies in fine fashion. That's twenty-four (24) free hush puppies the easy way. Only mild concern about regurgitating the quiet treats arose, though people entertained thoughts of power-chucking the meal at random targets on the ride back from the restaurant.<DIV CLASS='txtC'><IMG ALT='hush puppies' TITLE='hush puppies' SRC='imgs/icons/hpuppies_icon.gif' /></DIV>"

He started out the order with eighteen (18) medium and twelve (12) spicy garlic wings.  Not much of a reaction from the waitress -- she was not impressed. This chicken hawk tore through the wings like it was his job, barely stopping to sip his tasty beer.  By the fifteen minute mark he had already pecked away at twenty-one (21) of the first order.

  RecordSummary: "Ate four (4) pieces in ten (10) minutes"
  RecordDetails: "Cam, in his first sanctioned food challenge on American soil, aimed to set the bar on deep-dish, Chicago-style pizza. Cuddly like a koala, but dangerous as a <a href=\"imgs/dropbear.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">drop bear</a>, he came out of the gate with three (3) pieces, tearing through the first two within the first four (4) minutes of the event -- go, Cram, go! After torching the third piece, it was back to the buffet for another piece and, much to the crowd's surprise (and delight), a plenteous pile of pasta! Bonzer!<br />\r\n\r\n<SPAN CLASS=\"indented\">W</SPAN>ithout hesitation Cam dove back in for that bar-setting slice. Brilliant! A bit slower rate of consumption on this historic piece, but he plodded on. Three, two, one bite left, done. Ripper! Ten (10) short minutes and the record was his! His reward to himself? Pasta! Cam crammed in the penne pasta with pride. Success -- tastes so good.<br />\r\n\r\n<SPAN CLASS=\"indented\">T</SPAN>here was a side story simmering as the main event transpired: a member of the crowd, enjoying his lunch at a leisurely pace, was closing in on the record that Cam had just set. The earbashing began, and eventually grew so powerful that Cam chose to reward himself again -- more pasta! An impromptu heads-up battle nearly ensued, and was narrowly avoided. Forks down.<br />\r\n\r\n<SPAN CLASS=\"indented\">S</SPAN>ome in the crowd noticed that, as the signals from Cam's belly finally began to make their way to Cam's brain, Cam's brain started to push back, if only subtly -- he was chocka. There was a thousand-yard stare, an iffy hiccup, and a jeopardous belch (common predecessors to the chunder from down under), but Cam eventaully forged through. The day was won.<br />\r\n\r\n<SPAN CLASS=\"indented\">W</SPAN>ith nothing left to do but to sit back with his pizza baby and to not brown his daks, proud Cam posed for the <a href=\"imgs/CamVictory2017.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">victory pic</a> -- just him and his little Kamgaroo in the pouch.

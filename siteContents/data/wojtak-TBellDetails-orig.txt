The IT folks at Quicken Loans held the great Taco Bell crunchy taco eat-off on Wednesday, January 27 2006.  Estimates of the number of tacos purchased range from approximately one hundred fifty (150) to one hundred eighty (180) tacos which were delivered in three large boxes.  IT teams were represented by the following:
- Network – Scott "Scoot" Kinlin
- Windows Engineering – "Wild" Bill Parker
- Windows Engineering – Joe "The Machine" Gazarik
- IT Business Office – Andrew "My Little Pony" Lemanek
- IT Business Office – Michael "Cowboy" Foster
- Data Center Management – Dan "Old Man" LoCicero

The contestants were given a half hour (30 minutes) to eat as many tacos as they could possibly stuff into their gaping maws.  The contest was held on the 4th floor of the Livonia 20555 facility on the ping pong table and was overseen by Ben "Ben" Van Heudsen.  Score was kept on a whiteboard by Jason "Mr. Metro" Slater, with each contestant raising his hand as each taco was devoured.

"Wild" Bill claimed that he was simply unable to chew fast enough to keep up with the others.  Andrew and The Old Man were strangely quiet throughout the challenge while Scoot seemed obligated to pound out belch after glass shaking belch in order to make room for his tacos.  It quickly became apparent that Joe "The Machine" Gazarik and Michael "Cowboy" Foster were the two to watch.  Odds were in The Machine‘s favor after a wonderful showing in the previous week’s warm-ups.  However, after about the thirteenth (13th) taco, The Machine seemed in need of service – The Cowboy, who had previously fallen behind, kept up his steady pace and eventually caught up to Joe.  It was noted that several scowls were thrown in the direction of the Cowboy, who shrugged them off with a silent smile and kept on eating.  It was theorized that the half gallon (64 Fl. Oz.) of water that The Machine was drinking may have been adversely affecting his appetite.  In the final minute of the challenge, excitement mounted and cheering was heard down to the first (1st) floor when The Machine, who was down by one (1) taco, and seemed to be dragging, stood up, grabbed a taco and attempted to shove the whole thing in his mouth.

In the end, it was the IT BO Team who gained bragging rights, with Michael "Cowboy" Foster tearing through seventeen and two-thirds (17 2/3 or 53/3) tacos, while The Machine crashed at seventeen and one-third (17 1/3 or 52/3).  So close.  The Cowboy, concerned about staving children in Asia, finished his eighteenth (18th) taco with a big grin on his face after time was up.  Slow and steady wins the race.

In the end, everyone was a winner as the extra tacos put in the "free food" area of the fourth floor kitchenette.

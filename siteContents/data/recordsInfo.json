After a ten (10) minute recess, he got back in the saddle.  He even doubled up on a couple of sliders, showing them who was boss.  Bam -- back came the wall.  AJ strained to get through the twenty-third (23rd) onion-briquette.

In order to get an edge in the competition, Greg slowly brought the milk closer to room temperature over a period of two (2) hours. Last minute protests by the current Most Milk title holder about skim versus 2% milk prompted Greg to add four (4) single serving size Half and Half creamer containers to the skim milk. After an impressive start and slurping down about 75% of the jug of milk in about two (2) minutes, Greg paused to showboat a bit. To please the crowd, Greg was able to work in his catch-phrase, \"it hurts\". Then, shortly after getting back to the challenge, the milk that Greg had already consumed was not enjoying the one-half (1/2) pot of coffee that Greg had for breakfast:  it wanted out. It came up once, but Greg gulped it back down. The next two (2) abdominal contractions could not be overcome in the same manner, and Greg chunked out the milk into a nearby trash can. Milk did not do a body good in this case. \r\nNote: one of the pictures is semi-graphic.",

Three (3) dozen Double Stuf Oreos.<BR />\r\n<SPAN CLASS=\"indented\">After</SPAN> one-third (1/3) of the package, Liz began to get serious about the treat.

Mmm.<BR />\r\n<SPAN CLASS=\"indented\">At</SPAN> the two-third (2/3) package mark came a food challenge staple -- the shakes. The Oreo Kid's steady hands began to tremble a bit, presumably due to the excitement (and potentially due to the 5.5oz of straight sugar in the cookies that she had consumed so far). As she neared the end of the challenge, Liz was able to retain control on at least one finger. She displayed said finger to the crowds without falter as a few hecklers began their \"eat another bag\" grumblings.<BR />\r\n<SPAN CLASS=\"indented\">Then,</SPAN> finally, the Oreo that she was looking for -- the last one. Success. Eighteen (18) ounces of Double Stuf Oreos in forty-five (45) minutes. Oh, and that sugar count? 8.25oz of sugar -- over one-half (1/2) pound. Not only did Liz get to indulge, but she ended up with a considerably fatter pocketbook.

It took another thirty-five (35) minutes to eat the final eight (8) tacos. This span of time included several stretching sessions, and a couple of walk-abouts during which AJ tried to coax his belly into settling down a bit. Some spectators feared (or hoped) that AJ would empty his tummy-tum, possibly in a vulgar display of power, but alas, no hurling was observed.

D-Day kept the almost all of the original verbage intact to accurately preserve the events of this fateful day </DIV><SPAN CLASS='indented'>We</SPAN> got into a discussion last week [13 Nov 2005] about a person not being able to drink and keep down a gallon of milk. One of our W-1s* (Dave Harper) said he KNEW he could drink and keep down a gallon of milk in/for one hour. Milk at the mess hall only comes in 250ml containers, so we figured 15 would be about a gallon [quick math: 0.991 gal.]. Dave chose \"Full Cream - NADA Fresh\" milk over skim; bold move. We are not sure if it is milk from a cow, a goat, or a camel. [Nutritional info omitted for space]. We received quite a few looks from the other patrons for the 15 bottles on one tray. Dave started strong at 0752. At 20 minutes into the challenge, he had downed 6 milks. \"That's a lot of fucking milk!\" was his first real hint at cracking. One of the more astute W-1s* went and got a 45 gallon trash bag; good move.<BR /><SPAN CLASS='indented'>A</SPAN> little later Dave [declared], \"I'm scared to burp.\" He finished number 7 by 25 minutes, and his eyes started to glaze over. At the halfway point, he [warned] \"you may want to keep that bag open\" and \"don't make me laugh!\". [Dave] finally choked down number 8 by 37 minutes, but he was hurting. At 40 minutes he had his head down on the table. \"I'm pacing myself\" he stated. At the 45 minute mark he had finished #9, all the time plotting how he would down the last 3 or 4 in the last couple of minutes. But the mess hall was closing, so we all grabbed the milks and started to depart. As we were discussing giving him a few extra minutes to offset the walking time, we looked for Dave. He had ducked into the emergency exit to expunge his milk breakfast. [The result] was a very heavy trash bag, and he almost got some sympathy pukers as we each weighed the bag. [Dave chug-a-lugged 0.594 gal. of milk].<BR /><SPAN CLASS='indented'>Young</SPAN> David now knows that it is not possible to drink a gallon of milk. He has also learned to listen more closely to his senior Warrant Officers. And a couple of us are $20 richer, thanks to young Dave. Hopefully pictures are to follow when we move North and get a better setup.<BR /><SPAN CLASS=\"smFootnote\">* W-1: US Army rank of Warrant Officer 1</SPAN><BR /><SPAN CLASS=\"smFootnote\"> - submitted by Bobo, CW3, brother to D-Day</SPAN>",

Matt, using his patented technique of splitting the wings with one smooth thumb stroke, was downing wings like it was his job. And, what goes with chicken?

Without regard for his well-being, he pushed on with the task. It was not until the twenty-eighth (28th) wing that Matt even had to set a wing down to pause and reflect. Then, as the timer neared the end, the pace drew to a halt at thirty (30) wings.
